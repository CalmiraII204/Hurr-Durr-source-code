## Hurr-Durr-source-code
- I always wanted to make a funny site like Hurr-Durr, so, I got some info about hurr-durr in the [WayBackMachine](http://web.archive.org), I also saw [this repository](https://github.com/Mydoge/hurr-durr), and looked at the source code of hurr-durr.cc.
- Now if you wanted to make one like this, ehh, just fork it. **(i dont care lmao)**
